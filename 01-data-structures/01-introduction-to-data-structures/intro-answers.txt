## How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
The line, pixel, and screen data structure all have methods that will allow access to manipulate the data elements.

## If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
The data elements are all stored as an array, they are sorted, and then searched for via a binary search.

## What other real-world data can each structure represent?
- Line data can represent any list of data that can be added, removed, searched and sorted.
- Screen data can represent a grid like a map.
- Pixel can represent information and it location relative to a grid.
