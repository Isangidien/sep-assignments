Doubling the array size has an exponential growth rate making it size inefficient, every time we double an array we are increasing the number of empty slots creating fragmentation. Array allocation means the potential for serious performance and memory fragmentation as the size increases.


Hash Values

lotr_runtimes["The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey"] = "3 hours, 2 minutes" - Hash: 19
lotr_runtimes["The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"] = "3 hours, 48 minutes" - Hash: 17
lotr_runtimes["The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"] = "3 hours, 7 minutes" - Hash: 16
lotr_runtimes["The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies"] = "2 hours, 44 minutes" - Hash: 8
lotr_runtimes["The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"] = "3 hours, 21 minutes" - Hash: 5
lotr_runtimes["The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"] = "3 hours, 55 minutes" - Hash: 4
